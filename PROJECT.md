# Attorney Time Track — Project Context

## Overview
Lean time tracking & billing app for solo/small firm attorneys. "The anti-Clio."

## Repo & Deployment
- **GitHub:** Rcv801/attorney-time-track
- **Local:** ~/workspace/attorney-time-track
- **Stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase + shadcn/ui + Tailwind
- **Live preview:** https://attorney-time-track.vercel.app/
- **Supabase project:** ibvmcjzhnkkgizagjmuo
- **Built with:** Lovable.dev (syncs with their platform)

## Dev Workflow
- **Hybrid:** direct push to main for small stuff, heads up for big changes
- Every push to main auto-deploys to Vercel
- Dev environment set up, build passes clean

## Research
- `research/competitor-analysis.md` — competitive landscape, pricing, strategy
- `research/reddit-pain-points.md` — Reddit pain points, feature requests, opportunities

## Strategic Direction
- **Target market:** Solo practitioners and small firms (1-10 attorneys)
- **Price point:** $19/mo solo, $29/mo firm (the $15-30 range is empty in legal billing)
- **Differentiator:** Built by a practicing attorney, lean/focused, no bloat
- **Positioning:** Track time. Send invoices. Get paid. Nothing else.
- Solo attorneys overpay 50-75% for features they never use with Clio/MyCase/etc.

## Key Findings from Research
- #1 pain point: Attorneys forget to track time → lost revenue
- #2: Existing tools too expensive for solos ($89-250/mo for Clio)
- #3: Everything is bloated — solos want billing, not all-in-one platforms
- Killer feature opportunity: Passive time capture (monitoring email/calendar, suggesting entries)
- No competitor was built by a practicing attorney

## Owner
- **Ryan Vantrease** (Rcv801) — practicing attorney, product vision
- **Atlas** — development, research, automation
