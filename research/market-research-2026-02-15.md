## 1. Competitor Pricing Update (February 2026)

| Competitor | Cheapest Plan | Mid Plan | Top Plan | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Clio** | $39-49/user/mo (EasyStart, annual) | $79-89 (Essentials) | $139-169 (Complete/Work) | Add-ons push real cost higher. Clio Work/Duo at $199-219/user/mo. Accounting add-on $29+/user/mo extra. |
| **Bill4Time** | $39/user/mo (Time & Billing, annual) | $59 (Legal Pro) | $80-89 (Enterprise) | Flat 2.95% payment processing (no per-txn fee). LEDES export in Pro+. Good value. |
| **TimeSolv** | $35-50/user/mo (varies by user count) | Volume discounts at 5+ users | eBilling add-on ~$229/user/mo | Budget-friendly. Annual starts ~$2,210 for small teams. Good cost/value ratio. |
| **Rocket Matter** | $39-55/user/mo (Essentials) | $69-79 (Pro) | $99 (Premier) | Free data migration. All features included. 7-day trial. |
| **PracticePanther** | $49/user/mo (Solo, annual) | $69 (Essential) | $89 (Business) | Free-for-life version for first 3 clients. Trust accounting in Business tier only. |
| **MyCase** | $39/user/mo (Basic, annual) | $89 (Pro) | $109 (Advanced) | 10-day free trial. Price increased from $59 to $89 for Pro tier recently. |
| **CosmoLex** | $89-109/user/mo (Standard) | $129 (Elite) | N/A | Built-in accounting (no QuickBooks needed). CRM add-on $147/3 users/mo. Most expensive entry point. |

### Key Pricing Observations

- **The $20-39/mo range is EMPTY.** No legal-specific billing tool exists below $35/user/mo. This is Attorney Time Track's primary pricing opportunity.
- **Bill4Time and TimeSolv** are the closest budget competitors but still start at $35-39/user/mo and are billing-only (no case management overhead = good).
- **CosmoLex** is the most expensive entry point at $89-109/user/mo but includes built-in accounting.
- **Clio's real cost** for a solo is often $100-150/mo when you add the features you actually need (accounting, CRM, AI).
- **MyCase raised prices** recently (Pro from $59 → $89), creating customer frustration.
- **PracticePanther** has a "free for life" tier (3 clients max) — interesting positioning but not practical for real practices.

### 2.2 Recurring Themes (Freshly Confirmed)

**🔴 Theme 1: "I don't need 90% of what Clio offers"**
This exact sentiment appeared in 5+ posts. Firms paying for full practice management suites when they only use time tracking, billing, and trust accounting. The 15-lawyer firm on TABS3 said it explicitly. The estate planning attorney called Smokeball an "overpriced turd" and Clio "clunky."

**🔴 Theme 2: Spreadsheet users are desperate but reluctant to switch**
Multiple posts show attorneys using Excel/Numbers for billing and IOLTA. One attorney's formula broke and undercharged $200. Another manages 400 trust accounts in Excel. They don't switch because every alternative is either too expensive or too complex. **This is our core acquisition target.**

**🔴 Theme 3: Bill4Time losing customers on price + mobile app quality**
Bill4Time was specifically called out for "increasing prices" and having a "horrible" mobile app. This is a competitor we can directly poach from.

**🔴 Theme 4: AI time tracking is the next battleground**
PointOne AI and Billables AI are emerging. Attorneys want AI to auto-generate time entries from their activity. Screen capture + API integrations (Outlook, browser, Adobe) + phone app + LLM-powered descriptions. This is where the market is heading.

**🔴 Theme 5: Trust accounting / IOLTA is a dealbreaker**
Multiple posts specifically about IOLTA management. Some attorneys manage it in spreadsheets. Some want it built into billing software. Some explicitly don't want cloud-based IOLTA. **Must-have for any legal billing tool to be taken seriously.**

**🔴 Theme 6: QuickBooks integration is expected**
Nearly every "what billing software?" post mentions QuickBooks integration as a requirement. This is table stakes.

**🔴 Theme 7: Credit card processing fee passthrough**
PracticePanther users specifically complained about inability to auto-add CC processing fees to invoices. Small but sticky feature.

**🔴 Theme 8: LEDES export matters for firms with corporate clients**
Attorneys billing corporate/insurance clients need LEDES format. Clio user described painful multi-step process. Competitors gate this behind higher tiers.

## 3. Market Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Price Gap

```
$0-19/mo  → EMPTY (no legal-specific tools)
$20-34/mo → EMPTY (massive opportunity — Attorney Time Track sweet spot)
$35-49/mo → Bill4Time, TimeSolv, Clio EasyStart, MyCase Basic, Rocket Matter Essentials
$50-89/mo → Mid-tiers of all competitors
$90-170/mo → Premium tiers, CosmoLex entry
$170+/mo  → Clio Work/Duo, enterprise
```

**→ Attorney Time Track at $19-29/user/mo would be the ONLY legal billing tool under $35/mo. This is the gap.**

### 3.2 Feature Gaps (What Attorneys Want But Nobody Offers Well)

| Gap | Evidence | Opportunity |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple, fast time entry** | Universal complaint. "Too many clicks." Timers are clunky. | One-tap timer, keyboard shortcuts, quick-entry bar |
| **AI-assisted time entry** | PointOne, Billables AI emerging but standalone/expensive | Built-in AI that drafts entries from calendar/email/activity |
| **Affordable IOLTA tracking** | Attorneys using spreadsheets because tools too expensive | Include basic trust accounting at base price |
| **Standalone billing (no PM bloat)** | "Does anyone use something simple solely for billing?" | Don't bundle case management. Billing-first tool. |
| **Good mobile app** | Bill4Time's app called "horrible." Multiple complaints about mobile. | Best-in-class mobile time entry |
| **Auto CC fee passthrough** | PracticePanther users asked for this specifically | Auto-add processing fees to invoices |
| **LEDES at base tier** | Competitors gate behind $59-79+ tiers | Include LEDES in base or low tier |
| **Excel migration path** | Hundreds of attorneys on spreadsheets | Import from Excel, gentle onboarding |
| **Offline-first option** | Some attorneys want local data, not cloud | Offline mode with optional sync |

### 3.3 Differentiation Opportunities

1. **Price: $19-29/user/mo** — Undercut every competitor by 25-50%. No one is here.
2. **"Billing-only" positioning** — Don't try to be a practice management suite. Be the best time tracker + invoicing tool.
3. **Excel migration wizard** — Import existing spreadsheet billing data. Onboard the spreadsheet attorneys.
4. **Trust accounting included at base price** — Don't gate behind premium tier.
5. **LEDES export included** — Don't gate behind premium tier.
6. **AI time entry** — Auto-suggest entries from calendar events, emails, phone calls.
7. **Speed** — Clio's #1 complaint is performance ("hangs and hangs"). Make speed a brand feature.
8. **No upselling** — One price, all features. Anti-Clio positioning.
9. **30-day free trial** (most competitors do 7-10 days) — longer trial = more conversions.
