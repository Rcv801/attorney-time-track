## TimeNet Law

**Website:** [timenetlaw.com](https://www.timenetlaw.com)
**Founded:** 20+ years ago
**Developer:** Perry (solo developer, indie)
**Platform:** Mac-native (desktop app)
**Target:** Solo attorneys & small firms on Mac

### Overview

TimeNet Law is a one-man operation built by a developer named Perry who has been running it independently for over 20 years. Its core identity is anti-corporate: no private equity backing, no support tickets — you call Perry directly. The product is Mac-native (not Electron, not a web app) and positions itself as "boringly reliable."

### Key Features
- **Time tracking** — one-click timers, visual time blocks showing gaps in the day
- **One-click invoicing** — generate and email invoices quickly
- **Trust/IOLTA accounting** — automatic retainer application, trust balance tracking
- **Task & deadline management** — personalized task views, automatic reminders
- **Calendar integration** — events can auto-create billable time entries
- **Document organization** — attach files to clients/matters, templates with auto-fill
- **Automatic payment follow-ups** — customizable reminder emails for unpaid invoices
- **Recurring fees** — set-and-forget monthly retainers
- **Multi-user permissions** — task delegation and role-based access
- **Tags & custom fields**

### Pricing
- Not publicly listed on website (free trial offered, no credit card required)

### Strengths (What Users Love)
- **Legendary personal support** — users consistently rave about calling Perry directly. "When it comes to customer service, Perry is the best" (Gordon M. Brown, Attorney). Bug at 9pm Sunday? He answers.
- **Mac-native design** — feels native, fast, not a clunky web wrapper. Appeals strongly to Mac-loyal attorneys.
- **Stability & reliability** — "boringly reliable" is a feature, not a bug. No surprise updates that break workflows.
- **Independent/no PE ownership** — transparent pricing, no "hostage situations," data ownership stays with the user.
- **Simplicity** — does what small firms need without feature bloat. "Does everything a solo or small firm could need" (Karen Stockmal, Attorney).
- **Easy transition** — "Perry's customer support makes the transition easy. I've never looked back" (Scott Eberle, Attorney).

### Weaknesses & Common Complaints
- **Mac-only** — completely excludes Windows and Linux users, which is a significant market limitation.
- **No cloud/web version** — no browser access, no mobile app (from what's visible). Limits remote/on-the-go usage.
- **Single point of failure** — Perry *is* the company. Bus factor of 1. Users depend entirely on one person for support, development, and continuity.
- **Limited online presence** — very few third-party reviews on Capterra, G2, or Trustpilot. Hard for prospects to evaluate.
- **No integrations mentioned** — no QuickBooks sync, no LEDES export, no API — at least not marketed.
- **Niche audience** — targets Mac-using solo/small firms; limited scalability for mid-size firms.
- **No video tutorials found** — limited self-service learning resources.

### Community Sentiment (Reddit/Forums)
- TimeNet Law has minimal Reddit presence. Mentioned occasionally in "best billing software" threads on r/LawFirm but rarely the top recommendation (Clio, PracticePanther, and Rocket Matter dominate those threads).
- Its niche Mac-only positioning means it doesn't come up in most general discussions.

## LeanLaw

**Website:** [leanlaw.co](https://www.leanlaw.co)
**Platform:** Cloud/web-based (with desktop tracker and mobile app)
**Target:** Small to mid-size law firms using QuickBooks Online
**Trustpilot Rating:** 3.3 / 5 (Average)

### Overview

LeanLaw is a cloud-based legal billing platform that positions itself as the bridge between legal time tracking and QuickBooks Online. Its core value proposition is seamless two-way QBO integration, eliminating double-entry. It offers time tracking, invoicing, trust accounting, e-payments (via Confido Legal), and reporting.

### Key Features
- **Time tracking** — browser, desktop tracker, mobile app, calendar view, timers
- **QuickBooks Online two-way sync** — the headline feature; eliminates reconciliation
- **E-payments** — integrated via Confido Legal for credit card/ACH
- **Trust/IOLTA accounting** — matter-based trust tracking
- **One-click invoicing** — customizable templates (3 on Pro, unlimited on Elite)
- **LEDES export** — available on Pro plan
- **Reporting dashboard** — productivity, utilization, realization metrics
- **User permissions** — role-based access on Pro plan
- **Compensation tracking** — Elite add-on
- **Matter-based accounting** — organize transactions by client/case
- **Modular/integration approach** — works with existing tools rather than forcing all-in-one

### Pricing
| Plan | Price | Key Differentiators |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Core** | $55/user/month | Time tracking, e-payments, reporting, trust accounting, invoicing, QBO sync |
| **Pro** | $75/user/month | + 3 invoice templates, LEDES export, user permissions, matter-based accounting |
| **Elite** | Custom | + Unlimited templates, priority support, custom reporting, compensation tracking |

### Strengths (What Users Love)
- **QuickBooks integration is best-in-class** — "If you use QuickBooks, it is truly a game-changer" (Trustpilot, Dec 2025). Multiple reviewers cite the QBO sync as the #1 reason they chose LeanLaw.
- **Easy to learn** — "very easy to learn," "fairly simple to use," "easy interface" are recurring themes.
- **Clean interface** — users appreciate the straightforward, uncluttered design.
- **Good onboarding** — specific shout-outs to onboarding staff (e.g., "Tracie's assistance with onboarding makes all the difference").
- **Long-term satisfaction for bookkeepers** — 9-year user: "effective and efficient way to save me time — no double entry."
- **Reasonable pricing** — "They have not priced me 'out of the market,' which is a remarkable thing given our inflationary times."
- **Modular philosophy** — doesn't force you into an all-in-one; integrates with your existing stack.
- **E-payment integration** — Confido Legal integration praised for clean workflow.

### Weaknesses & Common Complaints
- **Customer support declining** — "Customer service is almost non-existent now. No one answers their phone; their site questions are answered by AI bots" (Trustpilot, June 2025). This is a recurring and recent complaint.
- **Bugs and reliability issues** — multiple reports of disappearing time entries, billing errors, and desktop app issues. "The product has many bugs in all areas — time entry, billing, and reports" (Trustpilot, Dec 2024).
- **Trust accounting bugs are dangerous** — "Bulk paid invoices are not processed as paid. It is then possible to pay them a SECOND time... lean law will sometimes overpay, satisfying an invoice in full but leaving the trust account overdrawn. This is an ethics violation" (Trustpilot, May 2024). *This is a critical issue.*
- **Surprise price increases** — "They increased the price about a month after I subscribed and before I'm fully up and running" (Trustpilot, Aug 2024). Additional unexpected charges reported.
- **Not recommended for larger firms** — "I would not recommend LeanLaw to any firm larger than 1-5 attorneys" (Trustpilot, Dec 2024). Scaling issues.
- **Mobile app issues** — mentioned as buggy/problematic.
- **Desktop time entry errors** — the desktop tracker produces errors; online time entry described as "oddly designed."
- **No case management** — billing-focused only; firms needing case management need another tool.

### Community Sentiment (Reddit r/LawFirm)
- Multiple threads asking about LeanLaw reviews, suggesting interest but uncertainty.
- In a 2022 thread, a 7-attorney firm considering switching from Clio to LeanLaw noted Clio "does a lot of things, but not necessarily that well" and wanted "a smaller feature set that kicks ass" — exactly LeanLaw's pitch.
- Mixed sentiment: some enthusiasm about the QBO integration, but concerns about maturity and support.
- LeanLaw is often mentioned alongside Clio, PracticePanther, and Rocket Matter as an alternative for firms wanting a lighter solution.

### Video Tutorials
- LeanLaw offers product tutorials on their website (referenced on features page).
- YouTube search yields limited third-party content; most tutorials appear to be official LeanLaw-produced.
- No significant independent video review/walkthrough ecosystem found.

## Implications for Our Product

### Gaps We Can Exploit

1. **Support quality** — LeanLaw's declining support is a major vulnerability. TimeNet's support is great but doesn't scale. A product with responsive, human support AND scalability wins.

2. **Trust accounting reliability** — LeanLaw has had *ethics-violation-level* trust accounting bugs. This is a zero-tolerance area for attorneys. Rock-solid trust accounting is table stakes.

3. **Cross-platform availability** — TimeNet locks out non-Mac users. LeanLaw is web-based but buggy. A reliable cross-platform experience (web + native mobile) fills a gap.

4. **The "right size" problem** — TimeNet serves solos beautifully but can't scale. LeanLaw breaks past 5 attorneys. There's a sweet spot for firms of 2-15 attorneys that neither serves well.

5. **QuickBooks integration** — This is clearly a must-have for the target market. LeanLaw proved the demand; we need to match or exceed their QBO integration quality.

6. **Transparent, fair pricing** — Both have pricing complaints (TimeNet unclear, LeanLaw surprise increases). Simple, transparent pricing builds trust.

7. **Mobile-first time tracking** — Both have weak mobile stories. Attorneys track time on the go. A great mobile experience is a competitive moat.

8. **Bug-free basics** — Disappearing time entries and billing errors are unforgivable in legal billing. Reliability over features.

### Features Users Clearly Value
- One-click timers and time tracking that "just works"
- Quick invoice generation (seconds, not minutes)
- QuickBooks Online sync (non-negotiable for many firms)
- Trust/IOLTA compliance
- Clean, simple interface over feature bloat
- Direct, responsive human support
- E-payments integration
- Calendar integration with auto-time-entry

### What NOT to Copy
- All-in-one bloat (users fleeing Clio cite this)
- AI chatbot support replacing humans
- Surprise pricing changes
- Mac-only or any platform lock-in
- Complex onboarding that requires dedicated staff
