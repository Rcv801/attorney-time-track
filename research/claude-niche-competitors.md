## Market Gap Analysis
Three clusters exist, none span all dimensions:
1. **Indie + focused + privacy-first** (TimeNet Law, Time59) — nail philosophy, lack modern design/cross-platform
2. **Modern design + legal-specific** (LeanLaw, Bilr, PointOne) — look good but cloud-only, VC/PE-adjacent
3. **Beautiful UX + privacy-first** (Memtime $12-23/mo) — great design, local-first, but zero legal features

## Market Signals
- **PE consolidation accelerating:** ProfitSolv owns TimeSolv, CosmoLex, Rocket Matter, Tabs3, LexCharge, Law Ruler. Francisco Partners owns Bill4Time, PracticePanther, MerusCase, Headnote.
- **AI passive time capture exploding:** PointOne, Billables AI, MagicTime, Memtime, Inlet, Laurel (all funded 2022-2025) — but all tracking-only add-ons feeding separate billing systems.
- Combining effortless time capture + built-in billing would leapfrog the entire category.

## Recommendations
1. **Subscribe to LeanLaw first** ($55/mo) — closest direct competitor, study UX decisions, identify where $55 price + QBO coupling create friction
2. **Subscribe to TimeNet Law second** ($39.99/mo) — study emotional/philosophical playbook, see what 20 years of solo iteration looks like, identify where modern tech could dramatically improve
