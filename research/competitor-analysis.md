# Attorney Time Tracking & Billing Software — Competitive Intelligence Report

*Last updated: February 7, 2026*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The legal practice management software market is projected to grow from $2.11B (2025) to $3.59B by 2034 (6.72% CAGR) ([Market Research Future](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/legal-billing-software-market-29318)). The market is dominated by all-in-one platforms (Clio, MyCase, PracticePanther, Smokeball) that bundle time tracking with case management, document automation, CRM, accounting, and more.

**The core problem for solo/small firms:** These platforms are designed to upsell. Solo practitioners and small firms (1-10 attorneys) are forced to pay $49-$169/user/month for bloated suites when they primarily need **time tracking, invoicing, and basic matter organization**. Many attorneys report using only a fraction of features they pay for.

**Key market dynamics:**
- Clio is the undisputed market leader with the strongest brand, but is increasingly expensive with aggressive upselling (add-ons for CRM, accounting, AI, document automation)
- MyCase and PracticePanther compete on similar feature sets at similar price points
- Nearly all players have converged on the same playbook: basic plan as a hook, then push upgrades
- There is **no dominant lean, affordable, time-tracking-first tool** built specifically for the needs of solo/small firm attorneys
- General time trackers (Toggl, Harvest) are cheap but lack legal-specific features (trust accounting, LEDES billing, matter management)

**The opportunity:** A focused, affordable tool that does time tracking and billing exceptionally well — without the bloat — has clear whitespace in this market.

## 2. Competitor Breakdown

### 2.1 Clio (Manage + Grow)
- **Website:** [clio.com](https://www.clio.com/pricing/)
- **Market position:** #1 legal practice management platform. G2 Leader. Massive marketing budget.
- **Pricing (annual billing):**
  - EasyStart: $49/user/month — basic time tracking, billing, documents, e-signatures
  - Essentials: $89/user/month — templates, client portal, 250+ integrations
  - Advanced: $119/user/month — automation, custom reports, priority support
  - Expand: $149/user/month — includes Clio Grow (CRM/intake)
  - Monthly billing adds ~$10-20/user/month more
- **Add-ons (extra cost):**
  - Clio Grow (CRM): +$59-69/user/month + $399 one-time setup (unless on Expand)
  - Clio Accounting: contact sales for pricing
  - Clio Draft (document automation): contact sales
  - Manage AI: contact sales
  - Personal Injury module: contact sales
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.6/5 | Capterra: ~4.7/5
- **Strengths:** Best-in-class integrations (250+), excellent mobile app, strong brand trust, comprehensive feature set, good onboarding
- **Common complaints:**
  - Expensive, especially with add-ons — solo practitioners often spend $100+/month for what they actually use
  - Removed features without notice (e.g., Clio Scheduler payment linking), breaking accounting workflows ([Capterra review, Apr 2024](https://www.capterra.com/p/105428/Clio/reviews/))
  - Kanban/Matter Stages feature is rudimentary ([G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/clio-clio-manage/reviews))
  - "Costly to have Clio, but it does save having an extra employee" — grudging acceptance, not enthusiasm ([Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/105428/Clio/pricing/))
  - Constant upselling pressure
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Overkill for many. EasyStart at $49/mo is reasonable but limited; most useful features require $89+/mo.

### 2.2 MyCase
- **Website:** [mycase.com](https://www.mycase.com/pricing/)
- **Market position:** Strong mid-market player, owned by AffiniPay (also owns LawPay)
- **Pricing (annual/monthly):**
  - Basic: $39/$49 per user/month — case management, time tracking, billing, calendaring, client portal, unlimited doc storage
  - Pro: $89/$99 per user/month — adds AI writing, custom fields, 2-way texting, eSignature, intake, integrations
  - Advanced: $109/$119 per user/month — adds DriveSync, full-text search, document automation, split billing, open API
- **Add-ons:**
  - LawPay Payments: $0/month (processing fees apply)
  - MyCase Accounting: $39/month per accounting user
  - Website: $100/month + build fee
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.4/5 | Capterra: ~4.7/5
- **Strengths:** Clean UI, good time tracking, LawPay integration, solid basic plan at $39/mo
- **Common complaints:** Limited integrations on Basic plan, AI features locked behind Pro, document automation requires top tier
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Basic plan at $39/mo is competitive for essential features. But custom fields and integrations require $89/mo jump.

### 2.3 PracticePanther
- **Website:** [practicepanther.com](https://www.practicepanther.com/pricing/)
- **Market position:** Popular with solo/small firms, known for ease of use
- **Pricing (annual billing):**
  - Solo: $49/user/month — basic features, internal chat, contact/matter management
  - Essential: $69/user/month — more integrations, automation
  - Business: $89/user/month — advanced features, reporting
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.1/5 | Capterra: ~4.6/5
- **Strengths:** User-friendly interface, good mobile app, Kanban task boards, solid automation at mid-tier, free data migration and training
- **Common complaints:** Solo plan is limited; many essential features require Essential or Business tier; pricing has increased over time
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Solo plan at $49/mo is basic but usable. The jump to $69 for integrations feels forced.

### 2.4 TimeSolv
- **Website:** [timesolv.com](https://www.timesolv.com/pricing/)
- **Market position:** Time-tracking-first tool, part of ProfitSolv family. More focused than the all-in-one players.
- **Pricing:**
  - 1-4 users: ~$44/user/month ($42 annual)
  - 5-14 users: ~$42/user/month ($40 annual)
  - 15+ users: ~$40/user/month ($38 annual)
  - Also references Pro plan at ~$20/user/month and Legal plan at ~$35/user/month (pricing appears to have changed/consolidated — now ~$55/user/month on their site)
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.4/5 | Capterra: ~4.6/5
- **Strengths:** Focused on time and billing (its core competency), 30+ reports, trust accounting, project management, CRM, client portal. Less bloat than Clio/MyCase.
- **Common complaints:** UI feels dated, less polished than competitors, part of ProfitSolv conglomerate raising concerns about direction
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Closer to the focused tool concept but still bundles CRM and project management. Pricing competitive at ~$42-55/user/month.

### 2.5 Rocket Matter
- **Website:** [rocketmatter.com](https://www.rocketmatter.com/pricing/)
- **Market position:** Established player, known for billing/payment features. Also part of ProfitSolv.
- **Pricing (annual billing):**
  - Essentials: $39/user/month — basic time, billing, 25GB storage, task management
  - Pro: $65-79/user/month — adds email integration, automation, document assembly, unlimited storage, more dashboards
  - Premier: $99/user/month — adds built-in accounting, split billing, fee allocation, ethical walls, custom permissions
- **Add-ons:**
  - CRM Core: $39/user/month
  - CRM Enterprise: higher tier
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.3/5 | Capterra: ~4.4/5
- **Strengths:** Strong billing features, Rocket Matter Pay included, good trust accounting, award-winning support (Stevie winner since 2015), free data migration
- **Common complaints:** 25GB storage limit on Essentials is restrictive, CRM costs extra, UI can feel complex, part of ProfitSolv raising consolidation concerns
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Essentials at $39/mo is competitive but limited storage is a real issue.

### 2.6 CosmoLex
- **Website:** [cosmolex.com](https://www.cosmolex.com/pricing/)
- **Market position:** Differentiates with built-in legal accounting (no QuickBooks needed)
- **Pricing (annual billing):**
  - Standard: $109/user/month — includes practice management + full legal accounting
  - Elite: $129/user/month — adds workflows, templates, advanced features
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.2/5 | Capterra: ~4.6/5
- **Strengths:** Only platform with truly built-in accounting (trust + operating), eliminates need for separate accounting software, good for compliance-focused firms
- **Common complaints:** Expensive entry point ($109/mo), steep learning curve for accounting features, UI not as modern as competitors
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Poor. $109/mo minimum is expensive for solos, and the accounting focus is overkill for attorneys who just need time tracking and invoicing.

### 2.7 LEAP
- **Website:** [leap.us](https://leap.us/)
- **Market position:** Australian-origin platform expanding in US, strong document automation
- **Pricing:** ~$149/user/month (pricing not publicly listed, requires demo) — reported from third-party sources ([Software Finder](https://softwarefinder.com/legal/leap-us))
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.2/5 | Capterra: ~4.6/5
- **Strengths:** AI-assisted drafting, excellent document automation, practice area templates, claimed 30% revenue increase for users
- **Common complaints:** Most expensive option, opaque pricing (must book demo), some financial reports difficult to customize, high cost not great value for smaller firms
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Very poor. At ~$149/mo with no public pricing, this is enterprise-oriented. Way too expensive for solos.

### 2.8 Smokeball
- **Website:** [smokeball.com](https://www.smokeball.com/pricing)
- **Market position:** Strong in document automation, known for automatic time tracking
- **Pricing (12-month plans, all "From $149/mo"):**
  - Bill: $149/mo — invoicing, time/expense tracking, online payments, trust accounting
  - Boost: $149/mo — adds matter management, calendar, client portal, Outlook integration
  - Grow: $149/mo — adds practice area templates, document automation, email management, AI features
  - Prosper+: $149/mo — adds firm insights, lead management, workflows, profitability reporting
  - Note: "From $149/mo" appears to be per-firm minimum, not per-user. Per-user pricing from third parties suggests $39-219/user/month range. Capterra reports $49/user/month starting.
- **Add-ons:** Autotime, FamilyPro, Intake, Workflows (some included in higher tiers)
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.7/5 | Capterra: ~4.7/5 (highest rated)
- **Strengths:** Automatic time tracking (standout feature), excellent document automation, strong practice area templates, high user satisfaction
- **Common complaints:** Pricing confusing ("from $149" for everything), primarily PC-based with web app as secondary, some features only in Classic Outlook (not Outlook web), add-on costs add up
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Mixed. Automatic time tracking is genuinely compelling, but pricing opacity and minimum cost make it hard to justify for true solos.

### 2.9 Toggl Track (General Time Tracker)
- **Website:** [toggl.com/track](https://toggl.com/track/pricing/)
- **Market position:** General-purpose time tracker used across industries, some lawyer adoption
- **Pricing:**
  - Free: up to 5 users — basic time tracking
  - Starter: $9-10/user/month — billable rates, project estimates, clients
  - Premium: ~$18/user/month — time audits, project forecasting, scheduled reports
  - Enterprise: custom pricing
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.6/5 | Capterra: ~4.7/5
- **Strengths:** Extremely affordable, clean UI, great timer, cross-platform, free tier is generous, 100+ integrations
- **Weaknesses for lawyers:** No legal billing (invoicing via integrations only), no trust accounting, no matter management, no LEDES support, no client portal, no legal-specific features whatsoever
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Great time tracker, terrible legal billing tool. Attorneys who use it pair it with separate invoicing (which is the pain point).

### 2.10 Harvest (General Time Tracker)
- **Website:** [getharvest.com](https://www.getharvest.com/pricing)
- **Pricing:** $11/user/month (single plan, all features). Free tier for 1 user with limited projects.
- **Ratings:** G2: ~4.3/5 | Capterra: ~4.6/5
- **Strengths:** Simple, affordable, good invoicing, expense tracking, project budgets, integrations with QuickBooks/Xero
- **Weaknesses for lawyers:** Same as Toggl — no legal-specific features, no trust accounting, no LEDES, no matter management
- **Solo/small firm fit:** Better than Toggl for invoicing but still requires supplemental tools for legal compliance.

## 5. Common Weaknesses — Where Incumbents Fail Solo/Small Firms

1. **Price-to-value mismatch:** Solo attorneys pay $49-149/mo but use maybe 20-30% of features. The most common sentiment: "It's expensive but I don't know what else to use."

2. **Forced bundling:** You can't buy just time tracking and billing. You must buy the whole practice management suite. Custom fields, integrations, and even basic reporting are often paywalled behind mid/upper tiers.

3. **Feature creep and complexity:** Every platform is racing to add AI, CRM, intake forms, document automation, and accounting. Each addition makes the UI more complex and the learning curve steeper. Solo attorneys don't need a CRM — they need to track their time and send invoices.

4. **Opaque and rising pricing:** LEAP and Smokeball hide pricing behind demos. Clio's add-on pricing requires contacting sales. Multiple users report unexpected price increases. CosmoLex's $109 minimum shocks solo practitioners.

5. **Add-on nickel-and-diming:** Clio charges extra for CRM ($59/user/mo + $399 setup), accounting (contact sales), AI (contact sales), and document automation (contact sales). MyCase charges $39/mo for accounting. These add up fast.

6. **Storage limitations:** Rocket Matter Essentials only includes 25GB. For document-heavy practices, this forces an upgrade.

7. **Breaking changes:** Clio has been criticized for removing features without notice, breaking existing workflows (e.g., payment linking from Scheduler).

8. **Poor solo-specific UX:** These tools are designed for firms with office managers and paralegals to configure them. Solo attorneys wearing all hats need something that works out of the box with minimal setup.

9. **Desktop/platform dependencies:** Smokeball's best features require Classic Outlook (not web). LEAP has desktop requirements. This limits flexibility.

10. **General time trackers lack legal features:** Toggl and Harvest are affordable but require attorneys to cobble together separate tools for invoicing, trust accounting, and matter management — defeating the purpose.

---

## 6. Opportunities — Gaps We Can Exploit

1. **The "just time tracking and billing" gap:** No legal-specific tool focuses primarily on time tracking + invoicing at an affordable price. You either pay $39-49/mo for a bloated suite or use $9-11/mo general tools that lack legal features.

2. **The $15-30/user/month price point is EMPTY:** Between Harvest ($11/mo, no legal features) and MyCase/Rocket Matter ($39/mo, full suite), there is literally nothing. This is prime territory.

3. **Trust accounting without full accounting:** Solo attorneys need basic trust/IOLTA compliance, not a full general ledger. No tool offers lightweight trust tracking without bundling enterprise accounting.

4. **Simple LEDES export:** Many attorneys need LEDES-format billing for insurance defense or corporate clients. This is locked behind $65-99/mo tiers. It should be standard.

5. **Attorney-built credibility:** None of the major competitors were built by practicing attorneys. This is a genuine differentiator that resonates with the target audience.

6. **Modern tech stack advantage:** React/Supabase is modern, fast, and cheap to operate. Competitors are running on legacy codebases with high infrastructure costs that drive their pricing.

7. **No-BS onboarding:** Solo attorneys don't want to "book a demo" or have a "guided implementation." They want to sign up, enter their billing rate, and start tracking time in 5 minutes.

8. **Mobile-first time capture:** The most common complaint across all platforms is that time tracking on mobile is clunky. A genuinely good mobile timer is a competitive advantage.

---

## 7. Strategic Recommendations

### Positioning
**"The anti-Clio."** Position attorney-time-track as the lean, affordable, attorney-built alternative for solo practitioners and small firms who are tired of paying for features they don't use. The tagline concept: *"Track time. Send invoices. Get paid. Nothing else."*

### Pricing Strategy
- **Free tier:** 1 user, unlimited time tracking, up to 3 active matters, basic invoicing. This gets attorneys in the door.
- **Solo plan: $19/user/month** — unlimited matters, full invoicing, basic trust tracking, LEDES export, client payment links. This undercuts every legal-specific competitor by 50%+.
- **Firm plan: $29/user/month** — multi-user, basic reporting, batch billing, expense tracking. Still dramatically cheaper than alternatives.
- **Annual discount:** 20% off (Solo: $15/mo, Firm: $23/mo annual)

This pricing is sustainable on a React/Supabase stack with low operational costs and positions you as the obvious choice for cost-conscious practitioners.

### Features to Prioritize (MVP → V2 → V3)

**MVP (Launch):**
- Fast, frictionless time entry (manual + running timer)
- Multiple simultaneous timers
- Matter-based time organization
- Professional invoice generation (customizable templates)
- Online payment acceptance (Stripe/LawPay integration)
- Basic trust/IOLTA tracking (deposits, disbursements, balance per matter)
- LEDES export
- Mobile-responsive web app (PWA)
- Hourly + flat fee billing

**V2 (3-6 months post-launch):**
- Expense tracking
- Batch billing
- Basic reporting (hours by matter, revenue by period, outstanding AR)
- Calendar integration (Google/Outlook)
- Client portal (view invoices, make payments)
- QuickBooks Online integration

**V3 (6-12 months):**
- Conflict checking
- Document storage per matter
- Split billing
- eSignature (integrate with DocuSign/HelloSign)
- Advanced reporting
- API for integrations

### What to NEVER Build (Stay Lean)
- Full practice management / case management
- CRM / client intake
- Full accounting / general ledger
- Document automation
- AI writing assistants
- Marketing tools / website builders
- Email management

These are the features that make competitors bloated and expensive. Let Clio and MyCase fight over that market. Own the "just billing" niche.

### Go-to-Market
- **Content marketing:** Write from the attorney perspective. "Why I stopped paying $100/month for Clio as a solo." Blog posts, Reddit (r/LawFirm, r/soloattorneys), lawyer forums.
- **Bar association partnerships:** Many state/local bars have practice management advisor programs. Get listed.
- **Word of mouth:** Attorneys trust other attorneys. A referral program (1 month free for referrer + referee) can be powerful.
- **Comparison pages:** SEO-optimized "attorney-time-track vs Clio" pages targeting attorneys searching for alternatives.

## 8. Our Differentiators

1. **Built by a practicing attorney** — Not by a tech company guessing what lawyers need. The founder lives the pain points daily. This is the single most powerful marketing message.

2. **Radically affordable** — At $19/mo, it's 50-75% cheaper than every legal-specific competitor. For a solo attorney billing even 10 hours/month, it pays for itself in the first tracked entry.

3. **Focused, not bloated** — Does 3 things exceptionally well (time tracking, invoicing, trust tracking) instead of 30 things adequately. Every screen, every click is designed for the core workflow.

4. **5-minute onboarding** — No demos, no sales calls, no "guided implementation." Sign up, set your rate, track your first time entry. Done.

5. **Modern, fast, reliable** — Built on React + Supabase (modern stack), not legacy enterprise software. Fast load times, real-time sync, works beautifully on mobile.

6. **No feature hostage-taking** — LEDES export, trust tracking, and reporting aren't locked behind premium tiers. Every meaningful billing feature is available to every user.

7. **No add-on tax** — One price. No surprise charges for accounting modules, CRM add-ons, AI features, or "guided implementation fees."

8. **Transparent pricing** — Listed on the website. No "book a demo for pricing." No "contact sales." Attorneys respect straightforwardness.
