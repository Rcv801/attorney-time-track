# You Didn't Go to Law School to Fight Your Software.

You went to advocate. To counsel. To build something of your own.

So why are you spending half your day wrestling with a time tracking system that was designed for a 200-lawyer firm — and priced like one?

## The Dirty Secret of Legal Tech

Here's what nobody in the industry wants to say out loud:

**Most legal software is built for the firms that don't need help.**

The enterprise players. The ones with IT departments and six-figure tech budgets and "digital transformation consultants." They get the demos, the white-glove onboarding, the roadmap influence.

You? You get the same bloated platform — minus the support, minus the customization — and a monthly bill that climbs every year for features you'll never touch.

You don't need practice management, document automation, client portals, e-billing workflows, AI drafting assistants, and fourteen integrations. You need to **track your time and get paid.**

That's it. That's the job.

## Time Tracking Is Broken. You Already Know This.

Be honest. How many billable hours did you lose last week?

Not because you didn't work them. Because you forgot to write them down. Because opening the app took too long. Because you told yourself you'd "reconstruct" your day later and then... didn't.

**The average solo attorney loses 15–30% of billable time to leakage.** Not because they're lazy. Because the tools make it harder than it should be.

Your current system probably does one (or all) of these:

- 🐌 Takes more than 2 seconds to start a timer — so you don't
- 🏗️ Buries time entry behind three clicks and a modal window
- 🧩 Forces you to pick from a dropdown of 47 task codes before you can bill
- 💸 Charges $50–$80/month for the privilege
- ☁️ Uploads your clients' matters to servers you don't control
- 🔒 Holds your own data hostage behind export paywalls

Sound familiar?

## We Built the Opposite.

**Attorney Time Track** isn't another legal tech platform trying to be everything to everyone.

It's a single-purpose tool that does one thing ruthlessly well: **capture every billable minute with zero friction.**

No onboarding. No training. No "implementation timeline."

Open it. Tap. You're billing.

## The Anti-Clio Manifesto

We believe:

### 1. Simple Beats "Powerful"
You don't need 200 features. You need 5 that actually work. Every screen in Attorney Time Track has one job. There's nothing to learn because there's nothing to figure out.

### 2. Speed Is the Feature
If it takes more than one tap to start tracking, you won't do it. We optimized for the moment between "I just picked up the phone" and "I should be billing for this." That window is about 2 seconds. We fit inside it.

### 3. Your Data Is Yours
Your clients' matters don't belong on our servers. Attorney Time Track works **locally first.** Your data stays on your device. Period. No cloud accounts required. No analytics on your billing patterns. No "anonymized" data mining. Just your files, on your machine, under your control.

### 4. The Price Should Be Boring
Not $65/month. Not $49/month "per user." Not free-with-a-catch. A fair price, once. The kind of price that doesn't show up in your overhead calculations. The kind you forget you paid because it just works and you moved on with your life.

### 5. You Deserve Tools That Respect Your Practice
Solo and small firm attorneys aren't "small enterprise." You're professionals running lean operations by choice. Your tools should match that philosophy — lean, fast, private, and out of your way.

## What It Actually Does

- **One-tap timers** — start billing in under a second
- **Quick capture** — retroactively log time entries in plain language
- **Client & matter organization** — just enough structure, nothing more
- **Export anywhere** — CSV, PDF, plain text. Your data leaves when you want it to.
- **Works offline** — because you bill in courtrooms, coffee shops, and places with bad WiFi
- **No account required** — download it, open it, use it

---

## What It Doesn't Do

- Practice management
- Document automation
- Client intake forms
- E-discovery
- Anything that would make it slower

We're not building a platform. We're building a scalpel.

---

## Built by Attorneys. Not by Salesforce.

We've sat in the same chair you're sitting in. Watching the clock, knowing we're losing money, dreading the end-of-month reconstruction ritual.

We built Attorney Time Track because **we needed it to exist** — and nothing on the market respected our time enough to be simple.

## Stop Losing Hours. Start Today.

Every day you spend fighting your tools is a day you're leaving money on the table and stress on your shoulders.

Attorney Time Track is ready when you are.
