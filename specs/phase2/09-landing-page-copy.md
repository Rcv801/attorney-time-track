## Problem Section

### Headline
**You don't need practice management software.**

### Body
You need to track your time, send invoices, and get paid.

That's it.

But every "legal billing" tool on the market wants to sell you a $89/month Swiss Army knife when all you need is a sharp blade. Case management. CRM. Document automation. AI drafting. Calendar sync. Client portals.

You use maybe 20% of what you pay for. The rest is noise.

**SixMin is the other 80% — subtracted.**

## Feature Sections

### 1. Timer That Stays Out of Your Way

**One click to start. One click to switch matters.**

A persistent timer bar that follows you across every page. Pause, resume, switch between matters without losing a second. Quick-switch with ⌘K. Pin your active matters for instant access.

Because the #1 reason attorneys lose revenue isn't bad software — it's forgetting to hit "start."

### 2. 6-Minute Billing, Done Right

**The legal standard, built into every calculation.**

Every time entry rounds to 0.1-hour increments automatically. Your rate, your matters, your billing — calculated correctly every time. No fumbling with spreadsheet formulas. No $20,000 billing errors.

*[Screenshot: Entry with rounded hours and billing amount]*

### 3. Invoices in Minutes, Not Days

**Select entries. Preview. Send. Done.**

Pick a date range, check the entries to include, preview your invoice, and email it to your client with a payment link — all in under 5 minutes.

Remember when "billing day" used to eat 10-30 hours of your month? That's over.

*[Screenshot: Invoice builder with entry selection]*

### 4. Get Paid Online

**Stripe-powered payments. Card or ACH. On every invoice.**

Your clients click "Pay Now" on their invoice email. Payment hits your bank account. Your books update automatically.

ACH bank transfers cap at $5 per transaction — way cheaper than LawPay's percentage-based fees on large invoices.

### 5. Trust Accounting That Won't Get You Disbarred

**Append-only ledger. Running balance assertions. Full audit trail.**

Every deposit, disbursement, and transfer is recorded permanently. Balances are mathematically verified on every transaction. You can't accidentally overdraw. You can't silently edit a record.

This isn't "good enough" trust accounting. It's bar-audit-proof.

*[Screenshot: Trust ledger with running balance]*

### 6. LEDES Export — Included for Everyone

**Your competitors charge $65-119/month for this.**

Insurance defense work? Corporate clients requiring electronic billing? Export LEDES 1998B or 2000 format from any invoice. No premium tier required.

## "Built by an Attorney" Section

### Headline
**Built by a solo attorney. Not a tech company.**

### Body
I'm Ryan. I'm a practicing attorney in Kentucky.

I built SixMin because I was paying $89/month for Clio and using three features. Time tracking, invoicing, and trust accounting. That's it. I didn't need a CRM. I didn't need document automation. I didn't need "AI-powered insights."

I needed to track my time, bill my clients, and not get disbarred for trust accounting errors. For $89 a month. Every month.

So I built what I actually needed. And I priced it at what it's actually worth.

SixMin does three things. It does them really well. And it costs $19 a month.

**No VC funding. No PE buyout. No "contact sales for pricing."**

Just honest software from someone who uses it every day.

## FAQ Section

### How is this so cheap?
Modern tech stack (React + Supabase) costs a fraction to run compared to legacy platforms built on enterprise infrastructure. We pass the savings to you. Also, we don't spend millions on sales teams — the product sells itself.

### What about my existing data?
Import your time entries, clients, and matters from CSV/Excel. If you're coming from Clio, Bill4Time, or TimeSolv, we can help with migration.

### Is my client data safe?
Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use Supabase (built on PostgreSQL) with row-level security — your data is isolated from every other user at the database level. We're building end-to-end encryption and local-first storage for a future release.

### What if I need practice management features?
You probably don't. But if you do, use SixMin for billing and a separate tool for case management. We play nicely with others — your data exports cleanly.

### Can I use this for my firm (multiple attorneys)?
**Firm plan coming soon — $29/user/month.** Multi-user support with per-attorney reporting and batch billing. Join the waitlist.

### What's a "6-minute increment"?
The legal billing standard. Attorneys bill in 0.1-hour increments (6 minutes). A 2-minute phone call gets billed as 0.1 hours. A 7-minute email gets billed as 0.2 hours. SixMin handles this automatically — that's where the name comes from.

### Do you have a mobile app?
SixMin is a responsive web app that works beautifully on your phone. Install it to your home screen (PWA) for an app-like experience. Native iOS and Android apps are on the roadmap.

### What about QuickBooks integration?
Coming in Phase 3. For now, export your invoice and payment data as CSV and import into QuickBooks.
